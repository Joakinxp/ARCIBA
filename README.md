# ARCIBA Data Processing Utility

## Hey there! 👋

Welcome to my little corner on GitHub where numbers meet code. I'm an accountant, and this is my side quest into the realm of Python programming. What you'll find here is a short script I've brewed to tackle a challenge that's pretty common in the financial and accounting world – sift through piles of data to identify the information that matters, something that can be done with more friendly user tools like Acces, but since it´s something I have to do monthly, is better to automate.

## What This Does 📈

Imagine having a long list of suppliers and clients and you need to find some specific ones quickly. That's what this script is for. It takes a big text file and filters out the important bits, saving them into easy-to-read CSV files.

And the best part? It sends those files straight to your inbox so you can actually take that coffee break in peace.

## My Coding Adventure 🌟

As someone who deals with economics, not eurekas, learning to program was a journey outside my comfort zone. But I took the challenge head-on, and here's what I made!

## How It Works 🔍

Picks up a text file that's a little too full of data.
Cleans it up and gives it some proper column names.
Finds the active suppliers and clients you're looking for.
Puts this info into neat CSV files.
Sends an email with these files attached—no need to wait around!

## Tools I Used 🛠

Python: For all the step-by-step magic.
Pandas: Because data can be messy, and we need to tidy it up.
smtplib & email: The helpers that deliver our digital mail.
dotenv: Keeps our secrets (like passwords) safe from prying eyes.

## Lessons Along the Way 📘

Every step in writing this code taught me something new. It showed me that with a bit of persistence, anyone can learn to automate their tasks.

Feel free to dive in, see what I've done, and maybe add some touches of your own!

Cheers,
Joaquin
